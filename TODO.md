# Dive Travel Buddy - Development Tasks

## Current Status

- Basic React application setup with vanilla CSS
- UI components for experience level, diving interests, and travel season
- Basic responsive design implemented
- Recommendation history with local storage persistence

## Next Steps

### 1. OpenAI Integration

- [x] Add OpenAI API key configuration
- [x] Implement streaming response handling
- [x] Add error handling for API calls
- [x] Add loading states during API calls

### 2. UI Enhancements

- [x] Add animations for button interactions
- [x] Implement a loading animation for the recommendation generation
- [x] Add a proper error message component
- [x] Add tooltips for diving experience levels
- [x] Improve mobile responsiveness

### 3. Features

- [x] Add recommendation history
- [x] Recommendation layout doesn't look good, it would be better to have a cards like layout per location if it's possible from the response
- [x] Implement save/bookmark functionality for favorite destinations
- [x] Instead of Beginner, Intermediate, Advance, we should also allow the user to specify the certification from PADI or SSI or TDI etc.
- [x] Add more detailed diving preferences (water temperature, visibility, etc.)
- [x] The Additional Preferences should be moved to a section below the other settings that spans the whole widths of that area and within the sections should be arranged smaller and with check boxes
- [ ] Travel Season is only considering northern hemisphere, better to use calendar months?
- [ ] Add images for recommended destinations
- [ ] Add weather information for recommended locations

### 4. Technical Improvements

- [x] Add proper TypeScript support
- [ ] Implement proper state management (Context or Redux)
- [ ] Add unit tests for components
- [ ] Add E2E tests for main user flows
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add proper logging

### 5. Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for components
- [ ] Create proper README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines
- [ ] Document API integration details

### 6. Performance

- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add proper caching for API responses
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 7. Accessibility

- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add screen reader support
- [ ] Test with accessibility tools

### 8. Security

- [ ] Implement proper API key handling
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Implement proper CORS settings

## Long-term Ideas

- Integration with actual diving sites APIs
- User accounts and preferences saving
- Community features (reviews, ratings)
- Dive log integration
- Weather forecasts integration
- Dive center booking integration
